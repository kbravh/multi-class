<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Multi-inheritance/composition is a very useful feature of Object Oriented Programming, but JavaScript's `Class` syntactic sugar does not allow for extending multiple parent classes. This library provides an easy way to solve that, without the need for mixin chains or functions.


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This library has zero dependencies. To get up and running in your project, just go ahead and install.

### Installation
 
Install the library with

``` bash
npm install multi-class
```
or
``` bash
yarn add multi-class
```


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage
Import the library, then create a couple of parent classes. A common pattern uses "Has" or "With".

``` JS
const multiclass = require('multi-class')

class HasName {
  constructor({name}){
    this.name = name
  }
}

class HasAge {
  constructor({age}){
    this.age = age
  }
}
```

Then, create your subclass and extend the parent classes using the `multi-class` function.

``` JS
class Person extends multiclass(HasName, HasAge){
  // The constructor is called implicitly

  getNameAndAge(){
    return `${this.name} is ${this.age} years old.`
  }
}
```

Finally, create an instance of your new class and see the magic!

``` JS
let person = new Person({
  age: 22,
  name: "Leeloo"
})

person.getNameAndAge() // Leeloo is 22 years old.
```

**Nota bene:** If your parent classes have different parameters for their respective constructors, an easy way to handle this is by passing in all arguments in a JSON object and destructuring them in the constructors, as is done above.

### Options

Don't like the name `multiclass`? Just change the name on import and inherit to your heart's content.

``` JS
const ðŸ¤– = require('multi-class')

class Person extends ðŸ¤–(HasName, HasAge){...}
```
